## About Fitpulse

We are a technology-driven company with a primary focus on enhancing your health and fitness. Life can be hectic with work, family, and other responsibilities, often leaving little time for maintaining a consistent fitness routine. This can lead to poor health and lasting consequences. We're here to solve that problem with our AI-powered fitness app. Users can choose their fitness goals, preferences, and workout types, and our AI algorithm will create a personalized weekly workout plan just for them. But we donâ€™t stop there. We partner with top trainers and gyms to provide access to guided workouts and fitness classes in select cities. All of this is available through a monthly subscription, where users can choose between one or two workouts per day, every single day of the month.
